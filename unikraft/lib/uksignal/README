This library provides a basic implementation of signals over
Unikraft. It supports signals between threads and process wide
signals.

It doesn't support signal codes, rt signals and executes the signal
handlers on the thread stack. It is also not yet integrated with our
irqs to deliver signals like SIGSEGV.
