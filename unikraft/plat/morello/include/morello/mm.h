/* From https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/docs/lesson06/rpi-os.md:
 * We need just one PGD and one PUD to map the whole RPi memory, and both PGD and PUD will contain a single descriptor.
 * If we have a single PUD entry there also must be a single PMD table, to which this entry will point.
 * Single PMD entry covers 2 MB, there are 512 items in a PMD, so in total the whole PMD table covers the same 1 GB of
 * memory that is covered by a single PUD descriptor.
 * We need to map 1 GB region of memory, which is a multiple of 2 MB, therefore we can use section mapping, and hence we
 * don't need PTE at all.
 * Finally, that means we need three 4 kB pages for the page tables: one for PGD, PUD and PMD.
